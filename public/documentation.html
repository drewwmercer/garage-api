    <div>Welcome to myGarage</div>
    <div>This is the server-side component of a "garage" web application. The web application will provide users with
        access to information about different vehicles, makes, modifications, and maintenance records. Owners will be
        able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their vehicles.</div>

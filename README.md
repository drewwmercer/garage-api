# garage_api

## About this project
This is the server-side component of the "My Garage" web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different vehicles, makes, modifications, and maintenance records. Owners will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create and maintain a list of their vehicles.

- See it live at: [my-garage-application.herokuapp.com](https://my-garage-application.herokuapp.com/)
- Read the API's [documentation](https://my-garage-application.herokuapp.com/documentation.html) for additional detaiils.

## Implementation
- Developed & tested locally using Postman, Mongo, Studio 3T and Visual Studio Code (CLI GitHub and Heroku deployment)
- Hosted on a Free Dyno thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)  
  - **Note:** This app is deployed on a free Heroku dyno. Free dynos will sleep after a half hour of inactivity (if they donâ€™t receive any traffic). This causes a delay of a few seconds for the first request upon waking. Subsequent requests will perform normally.
- Realtime log management via solarwinds papertrail add-on.
